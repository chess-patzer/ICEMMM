    <h6 align = "justify" style = "padding:30px" >Never before in the history of mankind that we have faced a situation where further deterioration
in climate, land and water bodies will lead to catastrophic and irreversible changes within next
10 years. The solution is to develop materials and technologies that are not toxic to living
organisms and environment so that planet earth remains a good place to raise our future
generations. Research community, worldwide, is aware of these problems and evidences are
emerging of responsible and ethical research to mitigate these problems. Among various
solutions, materials development and their responsible usage is key to resolve the contamination
of land, air and hydrosphere. For structural and non-structural applications, magnesium based
materials can provide a responsible alternative. Magnesium is one of the most abundant element
in planet earth that has nutritional characteristics as it is required for maintaining good bone,
muscular and neurological health. It is also the lightest metallic element (35% lighter than
aluminum) that can be used in multiple engineering and biomedical applications. Recycling of
magnesium based materials is not an issue due to its non-toxicity. Due to its low density, it also
ensures lower fuel consumption and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. This is of special
significance in weight critical applications such as automobile, aerospace, sports and space
sectors. However, unlike aluminum based materials, commercial magnesium based
alloys/materials are limited in number and also exhibit limited range of properties. It is thus
extremely important to responsibly develop magnesium alloys by minimizing the toxic alloying
elements and to further enhance the properties of magnesium and its alloys using composite
(nano/metastable and syntactic) technology. Accordingly, the main intention of this presentation
is to enhance the awareness of potential of magnesium based materials as an ideal choice for
sustainable planet earth.</h6>

    <h6 align = "justify" style = "padding:30px" >Wood based natural composite materials are exploited by humans since ancient times for
several load – bearing structures. Material intensive modern day aeroplanes, ships and wind-tubine
blades are designed and fabricated with long glass or carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites
leading to high specific strength and stiff designs. In this presentation, after a brief introduction to
composite materials, design and analysis of sandwich structures comprising composite laminates
as facesheets and polymeric foams as cores under static and impact loading conditions will be
discussed. The competing failure modes of facesheet failure, core shear and localised core
indentation failures through upper-bound analytical solutions, finite element based numerical
solutions and their comparison with experimental measurements will be presented. A case study
on the design and analysis of composite adhesive bonded joints under static and fatigue loading
will be discussed for primary structures and as a tool for composites repair will be discussed.</h6>
